## Description
The FDA evaluates the safety and efficacy of drugs, biological products, and medical devices, conducts inspections, and enforces regulations. It also regulates food production and distribution, conducts research, provides public health education, and monitors and responds to emerging health risks. The FDA's mission is to protect and promote public health by ensuring the safety and effectiveness of a wide range of products and substances. iVision is collaborating with the FDA to perform data analysis on the FDAâ€™s dataset. FDA has provided iVision with SQL script of their dataset. As an analyst at iVision, your role is to create informative reports by conducting a thorough analysis of the data using powerful tools like MySQL and Power BI.

### Part 2: Power BI Visualizations
1. Visualize the yearly approval trends of drugs. Highlight any significant patterns and/or fluctuations, if any.
2. Explore approval trends over the years based on different sponsors. Uncover patterns and changes in approval rates among sponsors.
3. Visualize the segmentation of products based on MarketingStatus.
4. Show the total number of applications for each MarketingStatus. Enable users to filter by years and MarketingStatus for detailed analysis.
5. Analyze the grouping of drugs by dosage form. Visualize the distribution of approvals across different forms. Identify the most successful dosage form.
6. Visualize drug approvals based on therapeutic classes. Identify classes with the highest number of approvals.
